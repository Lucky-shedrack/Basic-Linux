STEP1:
Open your terminal in Kali and run:

git clone https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher.git
cd zphisher
bash zphisher.sh

STEP2:
Run Zphisher from the folder:
bash Zphisher.sh

You’ll see a menu with platforms to choose from:
1. Facebook
2. Instagram
3. Gmail etc.

STEP3:
 Choose a Platform
For example:
Type 3 to simulate a Gmail phishing page
Press Enter


Step 4: 
Choose a Method of Hosting
You’ll be given hosting options like:

Ngrok (for internet access)

Localhost (only on your machine)

Serveo (alternative to Ngrok)

Choose 1 for Ngrok, then press Enter

*If you haven't already, set up Ngrok with your auth token




STEP5:
 Wait for the Page to Start
Zphisher will:

Launch a local PHP server

Create a public Ngrok link (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)

This is your phishing link:

 Step 6:
Send the Link to Target (In Test Environment)
Copy the Ngrok link and send it ONLY to your test subject (with consent).
Once the link is opened:
It shows a fake Gmail login page
If the victim enters credentials, Zphisher captures it in the terminal
You’ll see:
           Username: testuser@gmail.com
           Password: testpass123
